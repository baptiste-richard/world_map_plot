# Country Risk Score Project
### Columbia University - IEOR Department
### Standard & Poor's Global

In today's increasingly globalized world, firms are encouraged to expand their reach from their home countries into far-flung continents and countries in order to reach a larger consumer base. To evaluate the potential of conducting business in new geographies, firms assess the countries from various angles including the risk of a country defaulting on its debt obligations, the health of the banking sector, the size and growth of the potential market, as well as the risk of doing business in a country. Whereas the first three aforementioned aspects have appropriate quantitative metrics (sovereign, private credit ratings and sales data), the latter lacks a robust and all-encompassing metric that defines it. As such, this necessitates the need for a metric that captures the “risk of doing business in a country.” A metric that is capable of capturing several risk dimensions for a country covering the downside of a country’s business environment, including the legal environment, levels of corruption, and socioeconomic variables such as income disparity. As a company that seeks to provide its clients with the best tools for achieving the highest level of success in business, S&P Global Market Intelligence Risk Solutions has embraced the challenge to develop such a metric with the assistance of a group of Columbia University students in the City of methodology of the analysis undertaken, as well as this methodology.
